## Assignments

### Reflections (4 Total)
Write a brief critique on a specific exhibition or exhibit we visit throughout the semester. You must write a reflection for every Museum we visit. 4 Total

#### Things to consider:

From University of California Press, National Council on Public History, Exhibit and Museum Review Guidelines, https://tph.ucpress.edu/content/exhibit-and-museum-review-guidelines

... While reviews should be critical, reviewers should realistically consider what an exhibit can accomplish and note successes as well as shortcomings. All reviews should include:

* A statement of the exhibit’s significance. Will it be seen by large numbers of people, shaping the wider public’s understanding of the topic? Is it utilizing new technology in an interesting way? Is it innovative in its interpretation or design? Why should public historians be interested in this exhibit in particular?

* A consideration of the context of the exhibit’s creation and the visitor experience. A limited budget and other issues may constrain what a museum can accomplish. Understanding the curator’s goals (through exhibit materials or a discussion with the curator) and judging the exhibit’s effectiveness against those is better than holding an exhibit to an artificially high standard. Similarly, what is the visitors’ experience of the exhibit? Who is the audience for this exhibit? Does the exhibit engage that audience? How do we know?
Reference to public history scholarship, broadly construed. How does this exhibit reflect or extend relevant scholarship—which can range from an article on exhibition theory to a technical leaflet on exhibit design? What do we learn about exhibits from this example?

* Consider the exhibit’s longevity. How will this exhibit be viewed in 5 years? What does it add to exhibition practice?
